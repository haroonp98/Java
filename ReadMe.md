# Project Title

A simple concept based program called ConnectFour that uses OOP to allow for 2 player matches of either single or mutiple rounds.


## Description

Through the use of classes, methods, setters, getters, encapsulation, and general clean code base practices, alongside the use of test cases this program provides the user experience of the game called ConnectFour. With the incorperation of basic logic the program will allow for two players to play, save and resume matches. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing and running your program.



### Executing program

1. Create a new folder on your computer and place all files from this folder into there
2. Assure you have gradle running either via through docker or by installing gradle through terminal (if your using a mac)
3. In command line type "CD " and drag the file into the command line (Notice how I have added a space after CD), this should set the directory of location
4. Type gradle build
5. Type gradle run
6. Copy the command line given to you by gradle and run it into the terminal (the command line ends with ConnectFour.ConnectFour)
output: java -cp build/classes/java/main connectfour.ConnectFour
7. Now you should be set to player, ENJOY!!!
use code blocks for commands
```
